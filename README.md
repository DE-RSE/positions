# positions

Repository for official positions of the Society, target repo for the [positions community process](https://de-rse.org/en/positions.html).

Positions are developed in subfolders.

Upon acceptance of a position as official by the board, a PDF of that position will be created by the board based on a LaTeX template, and published to an open access venue of the board's choice (default: ArXiV for position papers which are also submitted to a journal; Zenodo for position papers which are *not* also submitted to a journal, i.e., standalone position papers). This publication is subsequently linked to from the [de-RSE website's positions page](https://de-rse.org/en/positions/). The source files for this PDF are merged into a numbered subfolder dedicated to that position.
